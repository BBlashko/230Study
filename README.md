1) Performance (Clock Cycles etc...) 
    
    CPI = CPU clock cycles/Instruction Count
    CPU time = (IC * CPI)/Clock rate
    
    
    # What is speedup formula?!
    
2) Virtual Memory 

    NEEDS WORK


3) Memory

    Static RAM (REGISTERS AND CACHE)
      - FAST, MORE EXPENSIVE (both space and manufacturing)
      - No refreshing needed when powered
    Dynamic RAM (MAIN MEMORY) 
      - SLOW, LESS EXPENSIVE
      - MORE DENSE
      - needs refreshing when powered (every 16-64 ns)
    
3) Cache  ******

    Temporal Locality
      - When info accessed, high probability it will be accessed again
    Spatial Locality
      - When info accessed, high probability nearby info will be accessed
      
    L1 (Primary) Cache
      - Smaller
      - Optimizes hit time to have shorter clock cycle 
    L2 (Secondary) Cache
      - 
      
    Disk Access Time = Rotation Time + Seek Time
    
    
4) Linkers, Loaders, Compilers

    Static Linking
      - as
      - Used for:
    Dynamic Linking  
      - as
      - Used for:
      
5) Fetch, Decode, Execute
